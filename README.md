## when making changes always commit to github:
this is the general flow
- git clone:
  - `$ git clone PROJECT_URL_HERE`
    - This means clone project floder to your local to work on a project
- add changes:
  - `$ git add .`
    - `$ git add .` means "add all of the changes that have been made"
    - or do `$ git add PATH_TO_FILE` if you just want to commit changes for 1 file
- commit changes
  - `$ git commit -m "you include a message describing all of the changes you have made here and why"`
- push changes to git server/host
  - `$ git push`
    - This pushes all the changes to the server
- Get any contributed or personal changes for a project
  - `$ git pull`
    - If anyone has made changes to the the porject "pull" the changes into your local copy

## Navigating you computer
- `$ cd`
  - This command is to "change directory"
- `$ ls`
  - This command is to "list" files in  a directory
- `$ pwd`

# Programming essentials
- All files must end with an extension so that editors and programs know how to read a file. Example: `section-1-4.html` the `.html` extesion means this is an html file so that web browsers know how to read it.
